Contrast Ratio Checker
----------------------
The design is based on Lea Verou's excellent contrast ratio checker: http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/
Checks the contrast between the text and the background colors.  If the contrast between the colors is not sufficient, another text color is suggested.
